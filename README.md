KdG MineralFlow is a logistics management system designed for Krystal Distribution Group (KdG) to optimize the flow of essential raw materials such as gypsum, iron ore, cement, petcoke, and slag.

The system manages the entire supply chain â€” from truck deliveries at warehouses to shipments via ports, while handling pricing, storage, invoicing, and commission tracking. Built using modern Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal Architecture, the project ensures scalability, resilience, and adaptability for future material types.
